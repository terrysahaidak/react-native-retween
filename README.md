## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
yarn add react-native-retween
```

Now we need to install [`react-native-reanimated`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated).

If you are using Expo, to ensure that you get the compatible versions of the libraries, run:

```sh
expo install react-native-reanimated
```

If you are not using Expo, run the following:

```sh
yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

If you are using Expo, you are done. Otherwise, continue to the next steps.

Next, we need to link these libraries. The steps depends on your React Native version:

- **React Native 0.60 and higher**

  On newer versions of React Native, [linking is automatic](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

  To complete the linking on iOS, make sure you have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed. Then run:

  ```sh
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```

- **React Native 0.59 and lower**

  If you're on an older React Native version, you need to manually link the dependencies. To do that, run:

  ```sh
  react-native link react-native-reanimated
  ```

## Quick overview

You can find this in the [example](example) folder.

```tsx
function TweenExample() {
  const { play, values, stop } = useTween(() => ({
    timing: {
      duration: 400,
    },
    // otherwise you can use spring
    // spring: {
    //   mass: 1,
    // },
    from: {
      width: 50,
      height: 50,
      left: 20,
      borderRadius: 0,
    },
    to: {
      width: 200,
      height: 200,
      left: windowWidth - 20 - 200,
      borderRadius: 2,
    },
  }));

  const [backward, setBackward] = React.useState(false);

  function onPress() {
    play(backward);
    setBackward((val) => !val);
  }

  return (
    <View style={s.animationContainer}>
      <View style={s.row}>
        <Button onPress={onPress} title="Toggle animation" />
        <Button onPress={stop} title="Stop" />
      </View>

      <Animated.View style={[s.animatedView, values]} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
